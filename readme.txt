The assignment is to implement the task mentioned above in Ruby.  Your
entire solution must fit in one file, you are not allowed to use any libraries
other than Ruby's core libraries and stdlib libraries documented at
                          ruby-doc.org


Your solution is expected to pass the provided test data which ends with
the suffix .in .  The correct solution ends with the suffix .out .  Your
answer must match exactly so that running a simple Unix diff command
verifies that your output is correct.

Your solution is also expected to not give any warnings from reek when
reek is run with the default settings.  Furthermore, you are not allowed
to have in your source code any comments that would cause reek to ignore
the default style settings.
